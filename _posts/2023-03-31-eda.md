## What is EDA?

Whenever we are presented with a new set of data it is very important to become familiar with the data. In a nutshell that is what EDA is. EXPLORATORY data analysis. Think of yourself buying a new car. Usually one does not just pay the money and take off like a racecar driver in the car without becoming a little familiar with the car beforehand. If I were buying a new car I would want to spend some time with it, walk around it, sit in it, look under the hood and take it for a short test drive. That way I can get a good feel for the car before I buy it and go speeding off in it. This the purpose that exploratory data analysis is accomplishing whenever we are presented with a new dataset and some questions that we're trying to answer. Before getting over-anxious, jumping right in and fitting models to our data set, it is always a good idea to explore the data first to check the general structure for things such as linearity and potential relationships between our response and explanatory variables. Just like checking out a car before we speed off in it.

## The Data

For this post we're going to be performing an exploratory data analysis on a data set about baby's birthweights. A baby’s weight at birth is strongly associated with various developmental problems and overall health of the child, which is why analysis of this data is important. The main purpose for analyzing this data would be identify or discover if the explanatory variables int this data set of Mother’s age, gestational age, mother’s race or gender of the baby have any effect on the response variable, birth weight.
