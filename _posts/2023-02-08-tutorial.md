## Why?
Let's get right to the point.
Througout the course of education at Brigham Young University I've taken a lot of classes that deal with data. Thats what you'd expect when your major is Statistics right? But most of the time the data that we use is being provided for us. We don't need to go through the process of gathering the data before we can start analyzing it. Yes, in bigger companies that would be a DBA's job and we wouldn't need to worry about it. However, I've found in my short professional career that you are much more valuable when you know how to get the information yourself from a database. Heck, just understanding how it works will will make your life in statistics SO much easier.
